# The Ceremony

Welcome to the beginning of Paige and Jason's forever. As we take this beautiful step forward, we warmly invite you to join us for a ceremony that marks the essence of our love. Set against a backdrop that deeply resonates with us, our gathering will be an intimate celebration, focusing on the heartfelt moments that bind us. Understanding the journey some of you will make to be with us, and mindful that our celebration is uniquely a ceremony with no reception to follow, we wholeheartedly respect and understand any decisions regarding attendance. Your well-wishes from near or far mean everything to us. It’s the love and support of our friends and family that truly embellishes this special day. Together, let’s make this moment a cherished memory, filled with love and the genuine joy of togetherness.

# Attire

The attire for the wedding is beach formal. This means that you should wear something that you would wear to a nice beach party

The ceremony will be held on the beach, so we recommend that you wear shoes that are appropriate for walking on sand. We also recommend that you bring a light jacket or sweater, as it can get cool in the evening.

The bride has requested that guests wear shades of white, khaki, or tan to match the beach theme of the wedding.
